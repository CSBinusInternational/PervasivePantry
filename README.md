# PervasivePantry
Pervasive Computing project:

In our final project we create a protoype of smart pantry that will identify if the inventory is running low. note: before you make the code usable i suggest you to download wireless IMU adapter application from google play store. the idea is to create a protoype that will act as a scale between the inventory and the gyroscope(the phone) if the data that send from the gyroscope is pushing through the limitation that we have set in the code. it will trigger the code to give a warning email that you have running low on inventory fell free to download and edit the code

features:

    give detail information about time and day of the low inventory
    email user of the low inventory
    create a log file of the history when the inventory is running low
